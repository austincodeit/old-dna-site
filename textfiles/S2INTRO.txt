In 1960, the City of Austin began construction on what would be the Ben White
and US Highway 183 interchange. In that same decade, the Dove Springs
and Franklin Park subdivisions
were platted, and they too saw
gradual development, with the
bulk of the houses built in the
1970s. The areas around
Peppertree Pkwy and Dove
Springs Road grew up first, with territories north of Teri Rd. following suit. The territory of Southeast Austin was annexed gradually in a series of small
annexations throughout the 1970s and 1980s.Also in the 1980s, the Southeast Corner Alliance of Neighbors (SCAN) formed to
respond to growing crime and gang problems in the Dove Springs area. By the mid-1990s, residents of the greater Dove Springs area had become
extremely organized through their own targeted efforts and through the CitySponsored
Self-Reliant Initiative. They reversed the trend of crime and gang
violence and provided outlets for the abundant youth population. They also
gained tools to help families purchase their homes and encourage better
maintenance of properties throughout the Southeast area.
