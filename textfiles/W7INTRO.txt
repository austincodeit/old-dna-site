<p>District W7 is characterized by the neighborhoods of Rosedale, North Loop and the Triangle, along with the established and recognized historic neighborhood of Hyde Park. The entire district is characterized by a large percentage of students, and young professionals affiliated with the University of Texas, especially in the Hyde Park neighborhood.</p>

<h2>Hyde Park</h2>

<p>Hyde Park was created as a master planned streetcar-suburb in 1891, far from the core of the city which emphasized large trees, wide sidewalks, for upper-class clientele. During the 1960s, the rapid growth of the University of Texas increased the demand for housing and rental property in the area. The decline of some of the neighborhood's older homes made it a prime target for demolition and removal, and building new apartment complexes. The Hyde Park Neighborhood Association was formed in 1974.</p>

<p>Hyde Park is a member of the National Historic Registry, as well as a City of Austin NCCD (Neighborhood Conservation Combining District)-- a zoning overlay "intended to preserve and protect older neighborhoods by allowing modifications to applicable regulations in accordance with a neighborhood plan for development and conservation." This has resulted in a marked difference in the built environment between Hyde Park and other parts of this district.</p>

<h2>North Loop</h2>

<p>This neighborhood is approximately 5 miles north of the downtown area. Within the North Loop Neighborhood Planning Area there are three active Neighborhood Associations. These are Northfield, Morningside-Ridgetop, and Eye 35/Airport Blvd. The closure of the Robert Mueller Airport in 1999 not only increased the quality of life of neighborhood residents by eliminating noise and other impacts; but the closure has contributed to the North Loop area becoming a more attractive and sought-after location.</p>

<p>North Loop is often referred to as a neighborhood in "transition." The neighborhood prides itself on a "funky" character, but is becoming increasingly upscale, with homes in the neighborhood selling for as high as $800,000.</p>

<h2>Rosedale</h2>

<p>The Rosedale neighborhood was farm and dairy land in the 1860s and in the 1900s was known for the nurseries and florists in the area. Most of the housing stock in this neighborhood was built during the 1930s and 1940s, although since the neighborhood is not protected by a NCCD or a Neighborhood Plan, many homes are today being remodeled with modern styling.</p>

<p>There are over 1200 homes in the area, a wide variety of businesses within easy walking distance, and an extensive network of medical services close at hand (including Seton Hospital). This neighborhood is primarily made up of single family homes, but the corridors along Burnet Road and N. Lamar Blvd are almost exclusively commercial.</p>
