<p>District N3 is in Austin, roughly bounded by Research Blvd. on the southwest, Lamar Blvd. on the east, and Rutland Dr. on the north. The US Census Bureau estimates its 2015 population at 16,576, most of which lives in rental units.</p>
<p>District N3 is characterized by well-established single family and duplex neighborhoods flanked by large multifamily housing units on the main arterials of Rundberg and Lamar, and industrial uses along Metric and Research Boulevard – which serves as the frontage road for US 183. Part of the district was once the town of Fiskville, which was annexed by Austin in the mid-1960s. With annexation came interim zoning regulation and a flurry of land use regulations that overlapped and led to sprawled growth throughout the area. 
</p><p>
As Austin expanded, homesteaders and small scale farms in the area sold their land to developers throughout the 1970s and 1980s resulting in the many office parks and subdivisions present today. Rapid highway construction has also affected the district. Research Boulevard became a freeway in 2002, and Lamar serves as a key north-south arterial for the city. 
</p><p>
The single family neighborhoods within the district share similar issues: increasing tax appraisals, resident turnover, and property neglect due to the high number of rental units. This area has not experienced major population growth.

This district is part of the greater Restore Rundberg and NET programs, which are aimed at targeting crime, blight and neglect in North Austin. The program funds community building, safety programs and restoration efforts propelled by a large federal grant.

Neighborhood groups oppose infill in residential areas and prefer growth along the commercial cooridors of Lamar and Rundberg. The area is largely single-family neighborhoods surrounded by multifamily mid-rises and commercial and industrial uses along the main arterials. However, single family homes often have multiple cars parked in the backyard and driveway, which may suggest a large number of residents not accounted for. The neighborhood plan envisions Lamar as a “Great Street”, the precursor to the current “Complete Streets” ordinance. Currently North Lamar through North 3 serves primarily as a major arterial catering to vehicular traffic with few affordances for cyclists and pedestrians. The neighborhood plan outlines strict design guidelines that mandate specific roof structures, home facades, and front yard setbacks. This seems to have deterred infill development and new construction in the neighborhood.

In District N3, property abatement cases comprise the majority of the neighborhood workload. Structure condition cases are the majority of cases for multifamily and commercial cases.</p>
