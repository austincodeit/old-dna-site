<p>District E5 lies in East Austin near downtown. It contains some of Austin's oldest neighborhoods, with development dating back to the 1840s. It includes Swede Hill National Register District, as well as several individual historic landmarks in the area. In the early 1900s, the district's social, religious and entertainment establishments supported a culturally rich population. Neighborhoods east of East Avenue (now I-35) contained nearly the entire African American population in the 1920s, with Hispanic communities relocating to the area shortly after.

Effects of age and neglect surfaced along the district's corridors after the construction of I-35 separated East Austin from downtown in the 1950s and rail yards along Fifth Street were abandoned in the 1980s. Efforts to reestablish the neighborhoods gained momentum with several community and City initiatives including Operation Impact, a Neighborhood Conservation Combining District for East 11th and 12th Streets, a Master Plan for the Central East Austin area in 1996, and neighborhood plans for the and Central East Austin neighborhood.

In District E5, property abatement is the most common type of complaint for the neighborhood team. Multifamily is roughly evenly split between land-use violations, property abatement, and structure condition. About half of the calls for the commercial group are land-use violations, while property abatement and structure condition also loom large.

The main focus of City and neighborhood efforts is to retain the historical and cultural identity of District E5 while encouraging new development. The Central East Austin neighborhood plan attempts to preserve the traditional neighborhood character while encouraging walkability and connectivity to surrounding commercial districts. 
</p><p>
Renewed interest in the area comes with its own set of challenges for existing neighborhoods. Many properties owned by families for generations are now facing market pressures in the form of increased property taxes and property maintenance costs. Affordability is a growing concern for residents, as is the changing landscape of social networks and community businesses.

The district is adjacent to downtown. The neighborhood is a predominantly residential area with approximately 70% of the total land use identified as single-family residential. East 11th Street is the primary commercial corridor and there are commercial uses along the IH-35 access road.

Roughly 10,000 people live in District E5. Based on the 2015 American Community Survey, 60% of its 3578 housing units are renter-occupied.</p>
