The Montopolis community was originally settled as a separate community on the outskirts
of Austin, surrounded by open fields which helped preserve the identity of the area. The
feeling of isolation in Montopolis is enhanced by the general street pattern. Vargas Rd. and
Montopolis Dr. run the entire length of the neighborhood and offer the only obvious access
to the area. An observer has the feeling of being in a distinct community with clear points of
entry. Prior to annexation by the City, the subdivision of land was conducted informally. This
resulted in lots of unwieldy shape and size in several areas, most notably between
Montopolis Dr. and Vargas Rd. The pattern of areas subdivided after annexation tends to be
much more like the remainder of the city.
