<p>District E9 is in East Austin, directly east of downtown. It is bounded by the Colorado River to the south, I-35 to the west, Sixth and Seventh streets on the North, and Pleasant Valley Rd. on its East. Its 2015 population estimate is 7401 according to the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey. About 57% of its 2939 housing units are occupied by renters.</p>
<p>District E9 contains some of Austin's oldest neighborhoods, with development dating back to the 1840s. There is the Willow-Spence Streets Historic District, as well as several individual historic landmarks in the area. In the early 1900s, the district's social, religious and entertainment establishments supported a culturally rich population. Neighborhoods east of East Avenue (now I-35) contained nearly the entire African American population in the 1920s, with Hispanic communities relocating to the area shortly after.
</p><p>
Effects of age and neglect surfaced along the district's corridors after the construction of I-35 separated East Austin from downtown in the 1950s and rail yards along Fifth Street were abandoned in the 1980s.
</p><p>
The main focus of City and neighborhood efforts is to retain the historical and cultural identity of the E5 while encouraging new development. The neighborhood plan attempts to preserve the traditional neighborhood character while encouraging walkability and connectivity to surrounding commercial districts. 
</p><p>
Interest in reconnecting East Fifth and Sixth streets to downtown has brought entertainment across the highway and opened new opportunities for locally owned restaurants and music venues, housing, and commercial properties. Other efforts to reconnect East Austin include a MetroRail stop at Plaza Saltillo, several B-Cycle community bicycle stations, designation of 11th street as a gateway to East Austin and improvements to pedestrian walkways. The City's Imagine Austin comprehensive plan designates Seventh Street as a Neighborhood Center where City and community efforts focus on creating an area that is walkable, bikable, and supported by transit. 
</p><p>
Future development is governed by several small area plans, including the neighborhood plan, the Plaza Saltillo Station Area Plan and Regulating Plan, and two Neighborhood Conservation Combining Districts. All of these efforts work together in an effort to improve the development quality of the rapidly changing East Austin neighborhoods and to help ensure a cohesive development pattern throughout the neighborhoods.

In District E9, the majority of neighborhood cases are property abatement cases. For multifamily and commercial, land-use cases are the most common type.</p>
