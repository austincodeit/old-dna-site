<p>District E8 is in northern East Austin, east of Springdale Rd. It includes the Johnston Terrace neighborhood of the Govalle/Johnston Terrace planning area and the MLK-183 neighborhood of the East MLK Combined planning area. The US Census Bureau's American Community Survey estimates its 2015 population at 9,066. Slightly more than half of its housing units are occupied by renters.

Johnston Terrace and MLK-183 are in historically underserved areas of the city. In 1931 the City developed the first zoning map following the blueprint established by the 1928 plan. These maps reflected some racial basis for distributing land uses – these undertones are reflected in the plan’s inclusion of land use descriptions such as “white residential”. 
</p><p>
A relatively common practice for urban planners in this period was to recommend the segregation of communities and to concentrate people of color and industrial uses in the less desirable parts of town. This practice appears to have influenced the initial land use pattern of Austin and the effects of this approach can still be seen in the distribution of land uses throughout the City. However, race was not the only determinant of where industrial zoning should be located. The presence of infrastructure such as railroad tracks in East Austin increased its viability as a location for industrial land uses. 
</p><p>
The varied and incompatible pattern of land uses in parts of East Austin may also be traced back to the period of cumulative zoning. Cumulative zoning is a zoning system that allows less intensive uses to be developed in any more intense zoning district. In a simple cumulative zoning system, the most restrictive type of district is residential.
</p><p>
In a residential area, only residential uses are allowed. The second most restrictive zoning is commercial. In a commercial district, both commercial and residential uses are allowed. The least restrictive district is industrial. A common effect of this approach to zoning was that on land zoned industrial, either industrial, commercial or residential uses may be developed. This permissive system resulted in residential and industrial uses being developed on adjacent tracts of land. This pairing of incompatible uses remains the source of many of the land use conflicts that characterize parts of East Austin to this day.

The area did not receive significant improvements to it urban infrastructure until the latter part of the 20th century. The streets were paved with curbs in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and sidewalks were installed on a few streets.

In district E8, the majority of Neighborhood complaints are property abatement complaints. For multifamily, structure-condition complaints lead, and commercial complaints are mostly split between property-abatement and structure-condition cases.</p>
