The S3 District is home to the West Congress Neighborhood and the Sweetbriar Neighborhood. Sweetbriar is the larger of these two neighborhoods. Williamson Creek flows through the West Congress Neighborhood. The entire disctrict is south of Ben White Blvd and west of IH 35. South Congress Ave and South 1st Street run north/south through S3. During the decade of the 1990s, the ethnic mix of the S3 District experienced a
marked shift. The Hispanic population made up only a minority of the district's populaton in 1990, but now Hispanics are the majority ethnic group in S3. While the Hispanic population has increased, the district's White population has decreased.
