The Georgian Acres neighborhood was entirely annexed into the city limits between 1945 and 1984.

<h2>St. John's and Coronado Hills</h2>
</p><p>
The St. John's and Coronado Hills neighborhoods are combined into a single planning area. The history of the St. John neighborhood dates back to 1894. At that time, under the leadership of Dr. L. L. Campbell, the St. John Regular Baptist association purchased 303 acres in north Austin. With the pressures of the great depression and families in need, Reverend A.K Black, the moderator of the St. John Regular Baptist Association, began subdividing the land in St. John into plots. 
</p><p>
Since the community was outside of the city service boundaries, they struggled to access city services, goods and essential items for everyday living. While part of the neighborhood was annexed into the city in 1951, the extension of city services to the area was slow. The greatest change to community dynamics came in the 1970s and 1980s. The rural fabric of the community was shifting to a more urban character with the introduction of apartments and subdivisions. Despite urbanization happening on the fringes, the St. John community still remained one with uneighborhoodved streets. The addition of much needed infrastructure did not take place until 1976. 
</p><p>
In contrast to the St. John neighborhood, the Coronado Hills community is much younger with development taking place post World War II. Specifically, the lands began to be subdivided and developed for the purposes of residential housing in the late 1960s. 
</p><p>
The land that now constitutes the Coronado Hills subdivision was platted and divided in the late 1960s. It appears that the development of the subdivision took place in three sections or phases dating from 1968 to 1972. The residential development typifies architecture custom to post World War II suburbanization. Specifically, residential development during this time period reflects a unified appearance where homebuilders took responsibility for developing multiple tracts versus individual architects working on single tracts. 
</p><p>
In the late 70s and early 80s two new housing types were introduced in the Coronado Hills neighborhood, condominiums (Old Town) and retirement housing (St. George’s Court). During this same time frame, new apartment complexes were being developed in St. John.
