The development of Windsor Park neighborhood began in the 1950s. Previously, the
land was primarily used for farmland; crops grown in the area included maize, corn,
and sorghum. Many streets in the neighborhood were former farm roads, including
Wheless. Wheless is a major street in the neighborhood that “jogs” at various angles
throughout Windsor Park, because it formerly bordered the perimeter of area farms. In
1960, construction of the Capital
Plaza shopping center
(located between IH-35 and
Cameron Road) was completed.
It was the first major
shopping center in the area,
predating the Hancock shopping
center on the west side of
IH-35 (built in 1964). As Windsor Park developed in
the 1950s, it was considered a
growing and active middleclass
neighborhood. The Windsor Park
Neighborhood Association formed in 1983 when
neighbors organized to protest the proposed
closing of the Windsor Park Branch Library. The Association managed to keep the
rented library space open and convinced the Austin City Council to build a permanent
branch library, which opened in July 2000 on Westminster Drive.
