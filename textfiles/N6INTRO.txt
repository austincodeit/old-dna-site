<h2>University Hills</h2>
<p>
In 1960, homebuilding in University Hills began under the joint venture of Carrington Built Homes and Lumbermen’s Investment Corporation. As the subdivision name suggests, all streets are named for colleges or universities. Building continued into the late 1960s in the general area east of Northeast Drive, bordered by Hwy 183 and Little Walnut Creek (south of Manor Road). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, approximately 150 homes on the northeastern edge of University Hills (near Langston and Hwy 183) were built by Bill Milburn Homes as Vintage Hills. Later, five apartment complexes were built within the University Hills boundaries.

At the time of its initial development, University Hills was a suburban neighborhood whose location provided convenient access to downtown via IH-35, and to northeast Travis County via Hwy 290 or Manor Road. This location provided (and still provides) an easy commute to many major employment locations downtown and along the highways on the neighborhood’s north and east boundaries. As the sections of neighborhood were built, developers promoted the area as a great place to live, especially for professionals, state employees, and those in the Air Force stationed at Bergstrom Air Force Base.

The ethnicities of residents in University Hills have shifted significantly. Many of the original residents have since moved out of the area and a more diverse group of people and families have replaced them. 
</p><p>
The majority of the housing stock in University Hills was built in the 1960s and 1970s. Including Windsor Park, 55% of housing units are single family, while 37% is multifamily.

These planning areas include the site of the former Fort Colorado, which was abandoned in 1850, and cemetaries of historical significance. Unfortunately, however, city planning documents have little information about the recent development of this area.
