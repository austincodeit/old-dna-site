Development first began in the northern portion of the Windsor Hills neighborhood (starting in the 1950s in Windsor Hills), and gradually worked its way south, into the Heritage Hills neighborhood. To this day, the Windsor Hills neighborhood is dominated by single family houses. And while over 60% of the Windsor Hills neighborhood is made up of single family houses, only 13% of Heritage Hills neighborhood consists of single family houses. The size, bulk, scale and design of the variety of houses in the neighborhood contribute to the diverse character of each neighborhood. In the neighborhood, residents cherish the large mature trees, quiet streets, and the quick and easy access to the downtown.

Between 1950s to 1970s, most of the Windsor Hills neighborhood residential area was subdivided and built out, consisting mostly of one story ranch houses, constructed out of brick or native limestone with two car garages.
